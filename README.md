### INTRODUCTION
Viper is a restricted subset of Python 3.x (with extra features) amenable to static analysis. The repository both defines the spec of the language and contains a reference implementation of the compiler, which compiles a legal Viper code to WebAssembly.

**Viper does not maintain semantic compatibility with Python**. Several dynamic elements known of Python are not available in Viper. For example, Viper doesn't have runtime module modification.

There are other similarly oriented projects, but they are all objectively different from Viper.

MicroPython is a well-optimized Python interpreter (with some JIT support) while Nuitka compiles Python to C. These two projects still allow dynamic aspects of Python, which means their performances may suffer from dynamically aspects of a program.

Also unlike Nim, Boo and Cobra, Viper tries to stick to Python syntax and semantics as much as possible and wherever it makes sense.

RPython is quite similar to this project, but the developers have [made it clear](https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#do-i-have-to-rewrite-my-programs-in-rpython) several times their goal is not to make RPython a standalone language.

### SETTING UP THE PROJECT
##### REQUIREMENTS
- [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - Python interpreter
- [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv) - Python package manager

##### STEPS
- Clone project
    ```sh
    git clone https://www.github.com/appcypher/viper.git
    ```

- Move to project's directory
    ```sh
    cd viper
    ```

- Install dependencies

    ```sh
    pipenv install
    ```

- Build the project [macOS and Linux]
    ```sh
    sh build.sh setup
    ```

- Compile and run sample viper code [WIP]
    ```sh
    viper samples/class.vi
    ```

### TESTING
##### REQUIREMENTS
- Same as [setting up the project](#setting-up-the-project)

##### STEPS
- You can run all the tests in a single command.
    ```bash
    pipenv run pytest
    ```

### ðŸ›  USAGE
- Show help info
    ```sh
    viper --help
    ```

- Compile and execute a Viper source file [WIP]
    ```sh
    viper samples/class.vi
    ```
